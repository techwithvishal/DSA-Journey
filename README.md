# 🚀 DSA-Solutions of my coding journey 

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms** practice repository!  
This repo contains solutions to problems I am solving on platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **HackerRank** using **C++**.

I’m currently pursuing MCA from **KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad**, and this repository is a part of my journey to become better at problem-solving and prepare for technical interviews.
